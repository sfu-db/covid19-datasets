# Detection of COVID-19 using Raman Spectroscopy
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sfran96/raman-spectroscopy-for-detecting-covid19?select=suspected_spectra.csv) focuses on how Raman spectroscopy could be used as a cheap and quick method to diagnose infection by SARS-CoV-2. The principal diagnosis method for SARS-CoV-2 is a PCR technique, which allows for the detection of a genetic material of a pathogen or microorganism and it has high specificity, sensitivity and helps diagnosing even in the first stages of infection. However, it is not the fastest method to use in this situation and it's very time consuming.

**Update Frequency:** No fixed update frequency (most likely a static dataset).

**Dataset stats:** Total dataset size is about 10mb, with 3 .csv each containing 300 rows and about 900 columns each.

### Codebook
--------------
Inside this dataset there're three files, each containing the raw spectra of healthy and infected subjects, unknown-state subjects and the probe used with saline solution inside. The data was in MATLAB's proprietary format and was transformed to CSV using Python's Pandas library
